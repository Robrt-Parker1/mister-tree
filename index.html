  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Expert Tree Pruning for Growth and Structure</h2>
    <p>Tree pruning in Hopkins MN is a crucial part of professional tree care. This practice involves removing dead, diseased, or weak limbs to encourage stronger growth, better airflow, and improved structural integrity. Pruning helps prevent the spread of disease, reduces the risk of falling branches, and enhances the overall shape of the tree.
